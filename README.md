# Simple Document Re-ranking  
A simple approach to re-rank documents in a clinical trials dataset using location-based features to improve retrieval relevance and accuracy.

## Overview  
This project focuses on enhancing document retrieval by incorporating location-based features for re-ranking clinical trial documents. The goal is to improve the relevance of search results through feature-based adjustments.

## Dataset  
The dataset contains clinical trial documents with extracted information, including:  
- **Document ID**: Unique identifier for each document  
- **Location**: Location-related information in the document  
- **Other Features**: Textual content and metadata  

## Methodology  
1. **Data Preparation**: Loading and cleaning clinical trial data from a structured dataset.  
2. **Feature-based Re-ranking**: Using location information to adjust document rankings.  
3. **Evaluation**: Comparing original and re-ranked results for retrieval accuracy.

## Key Technologies  
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)  
- Data Processing and Analysis  
- Location-based feature extraction  

## Business Insight  
- Improves the relevance of search results by prioritizing location-based information.  
- Helps enhance the document retrieval experience in clinical research.
